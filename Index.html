	<p><center>Hello My name is Suat Tahsin and I did a case study based on the NYC 6th train. I compiled a bunch of NYC subway stops zipcodes and using a website called niche, I found out the median houshold income and median rent for each zipcode.</center> </p>

			<center><h1>Analysis Of The Graph</h1></center>
			<center><p1>In conclusion the first two graph shows a
			decent correlation based on the niche ranking of best zip 
			codes to raise a family in nyc and my two chosen relationships. 
			However, from my data I did notice that a few of the places that have 
			lower median household incomes and median rent prices actually ranked 
			higher than some of the places with higher median rent prices and income. 
			This indicates that while there may be a correlation, 
			there are a few exceptions. In general though we wee that 
			the zipcodes that are best placese for familly are the ones were 
		rent prices are high, and median houshold income is high.</p1></center>
